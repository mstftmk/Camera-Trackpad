# Trackpad from Camera

In this repo, there is a “mouse with hand gestures” that I created with OpenCV, MediaPipe and pyautogui libraries. There are several things with that you can do with your hands:
- you can move cursor,
- you can click on items,
- you can make right click,
- you can scroll up and down.
